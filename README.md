# 🛒 Blinkit Sales Data Analysis with Python

> Ever wondered how data can reveal hidden stories behind everyday grocery shopping?  
> I did — and that's exactly what led me to dive deep into Blinkit's sales data.

## 📚 Project Overview

India’s quick-commerce market is booming and is projected to reach **$5.5 billion by 2025**. 🚀  
In this project, I analyzed real-world sales data from **Blinkit**, one of India's leading grocery delivery platforms.

My goal?  
To clean messy data, uncover meaningful insights, and find opportunities that could guide smarter business decisions.

This wasn't just about crunching numbers — it was about **telling a story through data**.

---

## 🎯 Business Problem

Blinkit wanted to understand:

- Which products are driving the most sales?
- How does fat content impact sales?
- Which locations and outlet types perform best?
- How does the size and age of an outlet affect its performance?

By answering these questions, Blinkit can make **data-driven decisions** about inventory management, expansion, and customer strategy.

## 🛠️ Tools & Libraries Used

- **Python**
- **pandas** (for data cleaning and manipulation)
- **numpy** (for numerical calculations)
- **matplotlib** & **seaborn** (for data visualization)

## 🧹 Data Cleaning Process

The original dataset was messy:

- Product labels were inconsistent — 'Low Fat' and 'LF' meant the same thing.
- Null values needed to be handled.
- Categories required standardization.

**Solution:**  
Using `pandas`, I cleaned and transformed the dataset so that every label, value, and entry spoke the same language.  
(Just like tidying up a cluttered kitchen before you start cooking — small steps, big impact!)

## 📊 Key KPIs Calculated

- **Total Sales**: `$1,201,681`
- **Average Sales per Item**: `$141`
- **Items Sold**: `8,523`
- **Average Customer Rating**: `4.0`

These KPIs provided a snapshot of Blinkit's health and sales performance.

## 📈 Visualizations & Insights

### 1. Fat Content vs. Sales (Donut Chart)

- **Regular Fat** products make up **60%** of sales.
- **Low Fat** products contribute **40%**.
- **Insight**: Despite health trends, customers still prefer regular options.

### 2. Sales by Item Type (Bar Chart)

- Top-selling categories: **Snack Foods**, **Fruits & Vegetables**, **Household Items**.
- **Insight**: Convenience and essentials are both important to consumers.

### 3. Sales by Outlet Location (Funnel Chart)

- **Tier 3 cities** led sales performance.
- **Insight**: Smaller cities are goldmines for growth.

### 4. Sales by Outlet Size (Pie Chart)

- **Medium-sized outlets** generated **43%** of total sales.
- **Insight**: They strike the best balance between reach and efficiency.

### 5. Sales by Outlet Establishment Year (Line Chart)

- **Older outlets** (since 1998) outperformed newer ones.
- **Insight**: Customer loyalty matters more than newness.

## 🔥 What Surprised Me

I expected Low Fat and health-conscious products to dominate.  
Instead, traditional Regular Fat products still ruled sales — a reminder that **consumer behavior doesn't always follow trends**.

Also, Tier 3 cities outperforming Tier 1 cities was a fascinating twist in the data story.

## 👨‍💻 What I Learned

- **Data Cleaning** is as crucial as analysis — clean data = trusted insights.
- **Visual storytelling** helps stakeholders connect with numbers emotionally.
- **Business understanding** is key — it’s not just about code, it’s about *why* the data matters.
- How Python libraries (like `pandas` and `seaborn`) can unlock hidden patterns in raw data.
